# Description
---
Hash is a data structure that works like an array but instead of having numerical value as an index you can specify "any type" of key:
________
#ARRAY
my_array = [1, 2, 3]
my_array[0] # 1

#HASH
my_hash = {'age' => 34, 'name' => 'Luke'}
my_hash['age']  # 34
my_hash['name'] # Luke
________
Assignment:
You have a test for a class and we want to know the average results for the class. Write a function that takes an array of hash with all of the grades/marks for a given test and returns an average grade for the entire class.
Input are in JSON (be careful ruby users, "string": is not a symbol)
